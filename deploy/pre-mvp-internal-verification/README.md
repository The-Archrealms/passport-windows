# Pre-MVP Internal Verification Evidence

Pre-MVP verification is required before citizen-facing token release, but it is not the MVP.

`Test-PassportPreMvpInternalVerification.ps1` requires controlled evidence for the PRD/ARD items that cannot be proven by unit tests alone:

- simulation runs;
- staff/steward pilots.

Copy the templates in this folder into the controlled verification evidence system, fill every placeholder, approve or sign them under the internal verification policy, then pass the file paths and SHA-256 hashes to the verifier:

```powershell
.\tools\release\Test-PassportPreMvpInternalVerification.ps1 `
  -SimulationRunReportPath <controlled-simulation-run-report.json> `
  -SimulationRunReportSha256 <sha256> `
  -StaffStewardPilotReportPath <controlled-staff-steward-pilot-report.json> `
  -StaffStewardPilotReportSha256 <sha256> `
  -OutputPath .\artifacts\release\pre-mvp-internal-verification-report.json
```

The same values can be supplied through environment variables:

```text
ARCHREALMS_PASSPORT_PRE_MVP_SIMULATION_RUN_REPORT_PATH
ARCHREALMS_PASSPORT_PRE_MVP_SIMULATION_RUN_REPORT_SHA256
ARCHREALMS_PASSPORT_PRE_MVP_STAFF_STEWARD_PILOT_REPORT_PATH
ARCHREALMS_PASSPORT_PRE_MVP_STAFF_STEWARD_PILOT_REPORT_SHA256
```

The reports must use the `internal-verification` lane and must prove that no production ARCH, production CC, Crown reserve balance, citizen production account history, or production service-liability record was created.
